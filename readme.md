# Vigenere

Vigenere is a program intended to encode and decode text via a Vigen√®re cipher system. It will be a Linux CLI program in x86-64 ASM, but it will require me the get the hang of parsing command line arguments and file IO using linux syscalls. 

It is my current work in progress, and, at present, is totally unimplemented.
